# MineCraft-Game

Welcome to my MineCraft Game!
This game is written in C# and is a WinForms application.
It's a desktop application where the player should avoid hitting the mines.
When the game starts, the players can see this text: "Let's try to avoid the mines!" and also their remaining lifes. Each game the players start with 3 lifes and if they hit a mine, their lifes are reduced by 1.
There are nine fields where the players can click and check did they hit a mine or not. Each game the fields start by displaying a question marks and there are three random mines placed in the background. Once any button is clicked, then the players understand what is behind the question marks. If they hit a mine, then the field where the mine is located shows image of red mine and their life is reduced by 1. If they avoid the mine, then the button will became in green colour. 
Once the players spent their all 3 lifes, then a message box will appears with this text: "Game Over!".
If they manage to avoid all mines, then the message box will display: "You Won!".
There is a button at the bottom called - "New Game", so if the players spent all their remaining lifes, the game will starts again by reset their lifes and hide again all opened fields by question marks. The new mines will be placed randomly in three different places.

Let's try to avoid the mines!
